      "Metsat is an exclusive meteorological satellite of ISRO in geo-synchronous orbit. This satellite is developed out of a small I-1000 bus made of carbon fibre re-enforced plastic light weight structure, a uni power bus employing an 18AH Ni-Cd battery and a single GaAs/Ge solar panel generating 640 watts of power. Metsat uses a 3-axis stabilized momentum biased attitude control system with suitable linearly controlled magnetic torquers for solar radiation pressure compensation. A unified propulsion system of bi-propellant apogee motor of 440 Newtons and the reaction control engines of 22 Newtons has been selected for efficient and versatile mission management.",
      "Metsat carries on-board a Very High ResolutionRadiometer (VHRR) and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) for weather data transmission. VHRR provides earth imageries in visible band with a resolution of2 km, in thermal infrared and water vapor bands with 8 km. DRT collects weather data from un-attended data collection platforms located throughout India and transmits the same to centrally located Meteorological Data Utilisation Centre. The satellite dry mass is about 495 kg. Metsat was launched on- board upgraded and modified satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) with a liftâoff mass of 1060 kgs in September 2002. After successful launch and early orbit operations and in orbit characterization of the Payload, the satellite has been commissioned for routine usage of weather data and imageries.",

      "Megha-Tropiques is an Indo-French Joint Satellite Mission for studying the water cycle and energy exchanges in the tropics. The main objective of this mission is to understand the life cycle of convective systems that influence the tropical weather and climate and their role in associated energy and moisture budget of the atmosphere in tropical regions. Megha-Tropiques provides scientific data on the contribution of the water cycle to the tropical atmosphere, with information on condensed water in clouds, water vapour in the atmosphere, precipitation, and evaporation. With its circular orbit inclined 20 deg to the equator, the Megha-Tropiques is a unique satellite for climate research that should also aid scientists seeking to refine prediction models. The Megha-Tropiques has day, night and all-weather viewing capabilities; it passes over India almost a dozen times every day, giving scientists an almost real- time assessment of the evolution of clouds.",

      "SARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from space using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System. Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc",

      "INSAT or the Indian National Satellite System is a series of multipurpose Geo-stationary satellites launched by ISRO to satisfy the telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology, and search and rescue needs of India. Commissioned in 1983, INSAT is the largest domestic communication system in the Asia Pacific Region. The satellite is monitored and controlled by Master Control Facilities that exist in Hassan and Bhopal. INSAT-3DR is a multipurpose geosynchronous spacecraft with main meteorological payloads (imager and sounder). The main objectives for this mission are to provide an operational, environmental and storm warning system to protect life and property. INSAT3DR is monitoring the earthâs surface, oceanic observations and also provide data dissemination capabilities. It provides Broadcast Satellite Services (BSS) through two S-band transponders. The data acquisition and processing system is established at Space Applications Centre, Bopal Campus, Ahmedabad, India. The processing of INSAT-3DR data is taken place broadly in four steps.",

      "INSAT-3A is a multipurpose satellite for providing telecommunications, television broadcasting, meteorological and search & rescue services. It carries twenty four transponders - twelve operating in the normal C-band frequency, six in Extended C-band and six in Ku-band. Nine of the twelve normal C-band transponders provide expanded coverage and the remaining three have India coverage beam. All the extended C-band as well as the Ku-band transponders has India coverage beams. INSAT-3A also carries a Ku-band beacon. For meteorological observation, INSAT-3A carries a three channel Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) with 2 km resolution in the visible band and 8 km resolution in thermal infrared and water vapour bands. In addition, INSAT-3A carries a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera which operates in the visible and short wave infrared bands providing a spatial resolution of 1 km. A Data Relay Transponder (DRT) operating in UHF band is incorporated for realtime hydro-meteorological data collection from unattended platforms located on land and river basins. The data is then relayed in extended C-band to a central location. INSAT-3A also carries another transponder for Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS & R) as part of India's contribution to the international Satellite Aided Search and Rescue programme. INSAT-3A was launched by European Ariane-5G Launch Vehicle into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) with a perigee of 200 km and an apogee of 35,980 km. The satellite is maneuvered to its final orbit by firing the satellite's apogee motor. Subsequently, the deployment of solar array, antennae and the solar sail is carried out and the satellite is commissioned after in-orbit checkout.",

      "Satellite data has been used to reconstruct ocean interior density and velocity anomalies in the Bay of Bengal through the âinterior + surface Quasigeostrophicâ (isQG) method. The inputs are sea surface height anomaly (AVISO), sea surface density anomaly; which is calculated using GHRSST sea surface temperature and SMAP sea surface salinity. One more input is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, calculated from in-situ analysis system (ISAS) climatological data. The results show that isQG retrieved subsurface density anomalies are very promising compared to RAMA buoy data in the cold season when EKE is minimum. Validation of retrieved density has also been performed using ARGO data which reveals that isQG is more promising when the stratification is weak .",

      "The main objective of the Megha-Tropiques mission is to study the convective systems that influence the tropical weather and climate. The Megha-Tropiques mission goals are as follows:",
      "The payloads have swaths of around 1700-200km. It is necessary to measure the above parameters for a minimum duration of 3 years in order to observe the inter-annual variability and getting an opportunity to observe El Nino-type events in the tropics.",
      "The satellite is launched into a non-sun synchronous orbit, unlike other IRS spacecraft. This Megha-Tropiques satellite carries four payloads namely, MADRAS-a microwave imager, SAPHIR-scanning radiometer instrument, SCARAB-scanner for radiative budget and GPS occultation receiver for atmospheric studies. The major orbit parameters are:",

      "The scientific payload contains the Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT) instrument.",
      "SCAT is an active microwave device designed and developed at SAC/ISRO, Ahmedabad. It is used to determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer is an active microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 25 x 25 km. The parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.900and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.600on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days.",

      "VHRR/2 is a modified version of the VHRR heritage imagers flown on INSAT-2A, -2B, and -2E. The VHRR observes in VIS, water vapor and TIR bands providing a spatial resolution of 2 km in VIS band and 8 km for the rest. VHRR was developed by SAC (Satellite Application Center), Ahmedabad, India. The instrument operates in three scanning modes:",
      "The nominal frame repetition rates are: 40, 30 and 20 minutes respectively. VHRR is an opto-mechanical system (whiskbroom type imager). The incoming solar radiation is reflected onto a Ritchey-Chretien telescope of 20 cm aperture by a beryllium scan mirror mounted at 45Â° to the optical axis. The optical system includes a gold-film dichoric beam-splitter that transmits visible light energy and reflects WV/TIR energy, so that the radiation from the Earth is channelized to the visible and IR focal planes simultaneously.",
      "The visible band detector configuration consists of two staggered arrays of four silicon photodiodes each; while two sets of mercury-cadmium telluride (MCT) detector elements operating nominally at 100-110 K sense the WV/thermal radiation. The scan mirror is mounted on a two-axis, gimballed scan mechanism system to generate a 2-D image by sweeping the detector instantaneous field of view (FOV) across the Earth's surface in east to west (fast scan) and north to south (slow scan).",
      "Schematic illustration of the VHRR instrument",
      "The DRT (Data Relay Transponder) is part of a DCS (Data Collection System) of ISRO. The objective is to collect data from unattended meteorological platforms in the ground segment. DRT receives receives signals from unattended weather data collection platforms and retransmits them to the central station. The data from these payloads are being used for comprehensive weather status and forecasting.",
      "RF communication of DRT: Uplink frequency = 402.75 MHz; downlink frequency = 4506.05 MHz; bandwidth =Â± 100 kHz; EIRP = 21 dBW (min).",
      "Note: MetSat-1 does not carry SAS&R (Satellite Aided Search and Rescue) system. In the INSAT-2 series, the INSAT-2A and -2B satellites carried SAS&R transponders as well as DRTs (Data Relay Transponders). According to ISRO information, INSAT-3A (launch April 9, 2003) and INSAT-3D (to be launched subsequently), will carry SAS&R and DRT payloads.",

This was the first satellite launched by the PSLV into the Geo-stationary orbit. The satellite was originally known as MetSat-1. On February 5, 2003 it was renamed to Kalpana-1 by the Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in memory of Kalpana Chawla?a NASA astronaut who perished in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.",
      "The satellite features a Very High Resolution scanning Radiometer (VHRR), for three-band images and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) payload.",
      "So far, meteorological services had been combined with telecommunication and television services in the INSAT series. MetSat-1 is a precursor to the future INSAT system that will have separate satellites for meteorology and telecommunication & broadcasting services.",

      "The scientific payload contains three instruments. Two are Indian and one is from the Italian Space Agency.",
      "OCM is an 8-band multi-spectral camera operating in the Visible and Near IR spectral range. This camera provides an instantaneous geometric field of view of 360 meter and a swath of 1420 km. OCM can be tilted up to + 20 degree along track.",
      "SCAT is an active microwave device designed and developed at ISRO/SAC, Ahmedabad. It is used to determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer is an active microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 50 x 50 km. It consists of a parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter which is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. It is an improved version of the one on Oceansat-1. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.900and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.600on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days.",
      "Radio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric Studies (ROSA)",
      "ROSA is a new GPS occultation receiver provided by ASI (Italian Space Agency). The objective is to characterize the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere, opening the possibilities for the development of several scientific activities exploiting these new radio occultation data sets.",

      "SARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from space using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System. Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc",

      "Satellite data has been used to reconstruct ocean interior density and velocity anomalies in the Bay of Bengal through the âinterior + surface Quasigeostrophicâ (isQG) method. The inputs are sea surface height anomaly (AVISO), sea surface density anomaly; which is calculated using GHRSST sea surface temperature and SMAP sea surface salinity. One more input is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, calculated from in-situ analysis system (ISAS) climatological data. The results show that isQG retrieved subsurface density anomalies are very promising compared to RAMA buoy data in the cold season when EKE is minimum. Validation of retrieved density has also been performed using ARGO data which reveals that isQG is more promising when the stratification is weak .",

      "India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, PSLV-C14, in its 16th Mission launched 958 kg Oceansat-2 and six nano-satellites into a 720 km. intended Sun Synchronous Polar Orbit (SSPO) on September 23, 2009.",
      "OCEANSAT-2 mission is an evolution of the OCEANSAT-1. IRS-P4 (OCEANSAT-I), launched in 1999, is a dedicated satellite for Ocean applications and carries two Payloads: Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) and Multi-frequency Scanning Microwave Radiometer (MSMR). Out of these two, OCM is providing valuable data which is used for various applications both within India and by International users. The most significant application areas are identification of Potential Fishery Zones (PFZ) using OCM data & prediction of Monsoon arrival using MSMR data. Experience from OCM data consisted into algorithms developed for atmospheric correction of the data and retrieval of parameters like Chlorophyll concentration, total suspended matter (TSM), estimation of primary productivity, detection of algal blooms.",
      "OCEANSAT-2 provides same operational services as OCEANSAT-1 while adding new ones like atmospheric vertical profiles of temperature, pressure and humidity, wind fields over ocean surface, sea state, Ocean dynamics , and bio-physical parameters.",
      "OCEANSAT-2 is equipped with three payloads: OCM, Scatterometer and ROSA. OCM was also present on OCEANSAT-I, Scatterometer and ROSA are new instruments. The OCEANSAT-2 data is received at the ISRO Ground Segment, located in Hyderabad, and also at the ASI Multimission National Centre (CNM) , located in Matera.",

      "SARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from space using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System. Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations.",
      "SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time.",
      "Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission.",
      "The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation.",
      "The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1.",
      "By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description:",
      "AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc.",

      "The INSAT-3DR is a momentum-biased 3-axis stabilized spacecraft using star trackers for precise pointing control. The spacecraft has a launch mass of 2211 kg with a dry mass of 907 kg. It is in Geostationary orbit, altitude of ~35, 786 km, location at 74Â° East. The three-axis stabilized geostationary satellite carries two meteorological instruments: a six channel Imager and an IR Sounder. Along with the channels in Visible, Middle Infrared, Water Vapor and Thermal Infrared bands, the Imager includes a SWIR channel for wider applications. The Sounder will have eighteen narrow spectral channels in three IR bands in addition to a channel in visible band. It also has a Data Relay Transponder and Satellite based Search & Rescue Payload. Several innovative technologies like on-the-fly correction of scan mirror pointing errors, biannual yaw rotation of the spacecraft, micro-stepping SADA, star sensors and integrated bus management unit have been incorporated to meet the stringent payload requirements like pointing accuracies, thermal management of IR detectors and concurrent operation of both instruments.",
      "A passive radiant cooler is used to cool the infrared detectors of imager and sounder instruments. The temperature of the detectors is maintained at 95 K (BOL) and 100 K (EOL). The passive cooler also maintains the sounder filter wheel temperature at 213 K.",

      "Megha-Tropiques is an Indo-French Joint Satellite Mission for studying the water cycle and energy exchanges in the tropics. The main objective of this mission is to understand the life cycle of convective systems that influence the tropical weather and climate and their role in associated energy and moisture budget of the atmosphere in tropical regions. Megha-Tropiques provides scientific data on the contribution of the water cycle to the tropical atmosphere, with information on condensed water in clouds, water vapour in the atmosphere, precipitation, and evaporation. With its circular orbit inclined 20 deg to the equator, the Megha-Tropiques is a unique satellite for climate research that should also aid scientists seeking to refine prediction models. The Megha-Tropiques has day, night and all-weather viewing capabilities; it passes over India almost a dozen times every day, giving scientists an almost real- time assessment of the evolution of clouds.",

      "The MetSat-1 spacecraft was developed by ISAC (ISRO Satellite Center), Bangalore. MetSat has been designed using a new spacecraft bus (I-1000 bus) employing lightweight structural elements like CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic). A central structural thrust cylinder provides mounting interfaces propellant tanks, pressurant tank, equipment panels, payload, solar array assembly, and with the launch vehicle.",
      "Structural brackets are provided to mount momentum wheels, reaction wheel, RCS (Reaction Control System) thrusters, earth sensors, sun sensors, LAM (Liquid Apogee Motor), and propulsion components.",
      "MetSat-1 is three-axis stabilized (momentum biased control subsystem). However, unlike its INSAT predecessors, the MetSat-1 spacecraft does not feature a sail/boom design. The attitude is sensed by suite of sensors (gyros, Earth sensors, digital sun sensor, coarse analog sun sensors, and solar panel sun sensor). Magnetic torquers serve as actuators to unload the momentum of the wheels. In addition, active thrusters are used (one 440N LAM for orbit raising maneuvers and eight 22 N thrusters for orbit and attitude control).",
      "The propulsion system employed is a unified bi-propellant with mono-methyl hydrazine (MMH) as fuel and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON3) as oxidizer. The S/C employs passive thermal control system by utilizing multi-layer insulation blankets, optical solar reflectors, heat sinks, paints, thermal grease, thermal shields etc. The temperature of individual subsystems spread over the satellite is maintained by a bank of 112 heaters.",
      "EPS (Electrical Power Subsystem): Electrical power of 550 W is generated by a single panel solar array of 2.15 m x 1.85 m using GaAS solar cells. The solar panel features a drive mechanism to point it into the sun. A single NiCd battery (18 Ah capacity) provides power for eclipse phases. The SADA (Solar Array Driver Assembly) slip rings and drive mechanism are modified to meet the power transfer and drive requirements, it is mass-optimized.",
      "The spacecraft has a launch mass of 1055 kg including 560 kg of propellant (495 kg S/C dry mass). MetSat-1 has a design life of 7 years with an operational goal of 10 years.",

      "The INSAT-3DS is a momentum-biased 3-axis stabilized spacecraft using star trackers for precise pointing control. The spacecraft has a launch mass of 420 Tonnes with Lift-Off Mass of 2275 kg . The nominal design life is 7.7 years. It is in Geostationary orbit, altitude of ~35, 786 km, location at 82Â° East. The three-axis stabilized geostationary satellite carries two meteorological instruments: a six channel Imager and an IR Sounder. Along with the channels in Visible, Middle Infrared, Water Vapor and Thermal Infrared bands, the Imager includes a SWIR channel for wider applications. The Sounder will have eighteen narrow spectral channels in three IR bands in addition to a channel in visible band. It also has a Data Relay Transponder and Satellite based Search & Rescue Payload. Several innovative technologies like on-the-fly correction of scan mirror pointing errors, biannual yaw rotation of the spacecraft, micro-stepping SADA, star sensors and integrated bus management unit have been incorporated to meet the stringent payload requirements like pointing accuracies, thermal management of IR detectors and concurrent operation of both instruments.",
      "A passive radiant cooler is used to cool the infrared detectors of imager and sounder instruments. The detectors temperature is maintained at 95 K (BOL) and 100 K (EOL). The passive cooler is also to maintain the sounder filter wheel temperature at 213 K.",

Kinetic energy of mesoscale variability is one order of magnitude more than mean circulation's one. Description of mesoscale is thus essential for understanding ocean dynamics, including mean circulation and its climatic effects (through interactions of meso-scale turbulence with the mean flow).",

      "The INSAT-3D is a momentum-biased 3-axis stabilized spacecraft using star trackers for precise pointing control. The spacecraft has a launch mass of 2000 kg with a dry mass of 907 kg. The nominal design life is 7.7 years. It is in Geostationary orbit, altitude of ~35, 786 km, location at 82Â° East. The three-axis stabilized geostationary satellite carries two meteorological instruments: a six channel Imager and an IR Sounder. Along with the channels in Visible, Middle Infrared, Water Vapor and Thermal Infrared bands, the Imager includes a SWIR channel for wider applications. The Sounder will have eighteen narrow spectral channels in three IR bands in addition to a channel in visible band. It also has a Data Relay Transponder and Satellite based Search & Rescue Payload. Several innovative technologies like on-the-fly correction of scan mirror pointing errors, biannual yaw rotation of the spacecraft, micro-stepping SADA, star sensors and integrated bus management unit have been incorporated to meet the stringent payload requirements like pointing accuracies, thermal management of IR detectors and concurrent operation of both instruments.",
      "A passive radiant cooler is used to cool the infrared detectors of imager and sounder instruments. The detectors temperature is maintained at 95 K (BOL) and 100 K (EOL). The passive cooler is also to maintain the sounder filter wheel temperature at 213 K.",

      "The INSAT-3DS spacecraft incorporates advanced Imager and Sounder instruments.",
      "The INSAT-3DS imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band.",
      "The Imager is an improved design of VHRR/2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A missions. The instrument features 6 spectral bands (against the 3 bands in previous versions) offering an improved 1 km resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution.",
      "This new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors.",
      "The INSAT-3DS sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional map of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere.",
      "The Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.",
      "Spectral parameters and sensitivity of the sounder",
      "Communication transponders are required to be configured to provide continuity of some of the INSAT services. A total satellite mass of 2000kg is considered for the launch compatibility, and 70 kg (approximately) of mass apportionment is done for the communication payload components. The communication payload components are - Meteorological Transmitter, Data Relay Transponder, Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R) Transponder & S-band Broadcast Satellite Services Transponder.",

      "Indian Space Research Organisation launched SCATSAT-1 for ocean and weather related studies and seven co-passenger satellites into polar Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO) on September 26, 2016. The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, in its 37th flight, (PSLV-C35) launched the satellites at 9:12 hours on September 26, 2016 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. The 377 kg SCATSAT-1 satellite have satellites from Algeria, Canada and USA, as well as two satellites from Indian Universities as its co-passengers. SCATSAT-1 is placed into a 720 km Polar Sun Synchronous Orbit, whereas the two Universities' satellites and the five foreign satellites are placed into a 670 km polar orbit. This PSLV mission is unique in itself as it is for the first time that its payloads are placed into two different orbits. PSLV-C35 launched from the First Launch Pad (FLP) of Satish Dhawan Space Centre and is the 15th flight of PSLV in 'XL' configuration (with the use of solid strap-on motors).",

      "The mission specifications call for determination of humidity with an accuracy of 10 to 20 percent in 5 to 7 layers of the troposphere, over 10 km pixels. For realizing that performance, it is necessary to choose channels for which the atmospheric contribution to the radiance comes from different levels of the troposphere. This can be obtained by sampling an absorption line of water vapour by channels more or less close to the centre of the line. A candidate line, already chosen for other instruments, is the line at 183.3 GHz. It is possible to get contribution functions peaking from heights of 2 km.up to 10 to 12 km in tropical redundant to use more than 5 channels. A sixth complimentary channel in a window regions has to be used to correct for the surface effects in the lowest channels; the 150 channel of MADRAS can be used for that. This is the principle of SAPHIR instrument, which has been studied in the frame of micro satellites.",
      "ScaRaB- Broadband radiation measurement instrument",
      "SCARAB is a four channel instrument mainly measuring in Visible (Sc1), InfraRed (Sc4) along with Solar Radiation (Sc2) and Total Radiation (Sc3). The long-wave irradiance is deduced from the difference between Sc3 and Sc2 measurements. Channels in Visible and IR window, Sc1 and Sc4 are used for scene identification (surface, clouds, partially covered) and for assuring compatibility and comparisons with the images from operational satellites.",
      "GPS Radio Occultation sensor enables measurement of water vapour and temperature profiles in the tropics. GPS ROS payload is there to supplement / complement the mission for the atmospheric studies. A GPS ROS payload, ROSA (GPS-ROS) provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), is configured as the fourth payload.",

      "INSAT-3A is a multipurpose satellite for providing telecommunications, television broadcasting, meteorological and search & rescue services. It carries twenty four transponders - twelve operating in the normal C-band frequency, six in Extended C-band and six in Ku-band. Nine of the twelve normal C-band transponders provide expanded coverage and the remaining three have India coverage beam. All the extended C-band as well as the Ku-band transponders has India coverage beams. INSAT-3A also carries a Ku-band beacon. For meteorological observation, INSAT-3A carries a three channel Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) with 2 km resolution in the visible band and 8 km resolution in thermal infrared and water vapour bands. In addition, INSAT-3A carries a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera which operates in the visible and short wave infrared bands providing a spatial resolution of 1 km. A Data Relay Transponder (DRT) operating in UHF band is incorporated for realtime hydro-meteorological data collection from unattended platforms located on land and river basins. The data is then relayed in extended C-band to a central location. INSAT-3A also carries another transponder for Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS & R) as part of India's contribution to the international Satellite Aided Search and Rescue programme. INSAT-3A was launched by European Ariane-5G Launch Vehicle into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) with a perigee of 200 km and an apogee of 35,980 km. The satellite is maneuvered to its final orbit by firing the satellite's apogee motor. Subsequently, the deployment of solar array, antennae and the solar sail is carried out and the satellite is commissioned after in-orbit checkout.",

      "INSAT or the Indian National Satellite System is a series of multipurpose Geo-stationary satellites launched by ISRO to satisfy the telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology, and search and rescue needs of India. Commissioned in 1983, INSAT is the largest domestic communication system in the Asia Pacific Region. The satellite is monitored and controlled by Master Control Facilities that exist in Hassan and Bhopal. INSAT-3DS is a multipurpose geosynchronous spacecraft with main meteorological payloads (imager and sounder). The main objectives for this mission are to provide an operational, environmental and storm warning system to protect life and property. INSAT3S is monitoring the earthâs surface, oceanic observations and also provide data dissemination capabilities. It provides Broadcast Satellite Services (BSS) through two S-band transponders. The data acquisition and processing system is established at Space Applications Centre, Bopal Campus, Ahmedabad, India. The processing of INSAT-3DS data is taken place broadly in four steps.",

      "Metsat is an exclusive meteorological satellite of ISRO in geo-synchronous orbit. This satellite is developed out of a small I-1000 bus made of carbon fibre re-enforced plastic light weight structure, a uni power bus employing an 18AH Ni-Cd battery and a single GaAs/Ge solar panel generating 640 watts of power. Metsat uses a 3-axis stabilized momentum biased attitude control system with suitable linearly controlled magnetic torquers for solar radiation pressure compensation. A unified propulsion system of bi-propellant apogee motor of 440 Newtons and the reaction control engines of 22 Newtons has been selected for efficient and versatile mission management.",
      "Metsat carries on-board a Very High ResolutionRadiometer (VHRR) and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) for weather data transmission. VHRR provides earth imageries in visible band with a resolution of2 km, in thermal infrared and water vapor bands with 8 km. DRT collects weather data from un-attended data collection platforms located throughout India and transmits the same to centrally located Meteorological Data Utilisation Centre. The satellite dry mass is about 495 kg. Metsat was launched on- board upgraded and modified satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) with a liftâoff mass of 1060 kgs in September 2002. After successful launch and early orbit operations and in orbit characterization of the Payload, the satellite has been commissioned for routine usage of weather data and imageries.",

    "description": [
      "The tropical belt receives more energy from Sun than it radiates back into space. The excess energy is transported to temperate regions by the motion of atmosphere and oceans. Any variation in the energy budget of the tropics will therefore effect the whole planet. The energy exchanges are strongly linked to the water cycle and particularly to the tropical connective systems: huge amount of latent heat are released in the tropical rains, while high humidity and thick clouds strongly affect the radiation budget. Many interactions between radiation, water vapour, clouds, precipitation and atmospheric motion determine the life cycle of convective cloud systems, and the occurrence of extreme events like tropical cyclones, monsoons, flood and droughts. Due to dynamic nature of above parameters, the frequency of observation from low orbiting sun-synchronous orbits is inadequate. Only geo-stationary satellites allow continuous monitoring of the Tropics, but their Vis-IR sensors give limited information on the cloud surface properties or horizontal distribution of water vapour.",
      "Low orbiting (~800 km) satellites with low inclinations provide high repetitivity. An inclination at 20 degrees provides 6 observations of each point on the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The most energetic tropical systems, such as the cloud clusters of ITCZ, the Monsoon systems and the Tropical cyclones, extend over hundreds of kilometers. Hence, a ground resolution of about 10 km is adequate for these observations.",
      "In order to meet most of the above requirements, Megha Tropiques has been envisaged which is low earth orbit (LEO) mission. Megha in Sanskrit is âcloudâ and Tropiques in French is âtropicsâ. Megha-tropiques Mission is an ISRO-CNES (Indo-French) collaborative programme intended for studying the water cycle and energy exchanges in the tropics using a satellite platform.",
      "Megha-Tropiques is a one-tonne satellite which will be operated as part of a joint programme between the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Franceâ²s Centre National dâ²Etudes Spaciales (CNES). The spacecraft was constructed by ISRO, based around the IRS bus developed for earlier Indian satellites, and carries four instruments which will be used to study the Earthâ²s atmosphere.",
      "ISRO is responsible of the system and the satellite. ISRO provides the launcher, the paltform, part of the MADRAS instrument, the GPS receiver and the mission operation center, which will process all the products until level 1. ISRO also performs the integration and test of the MADRAS instrument, of the complete payload and of the satellite.",
      "CNES provides a support for the system activities, the hyperfrequency part of the MADRAS instrument (MARFEQ) developped under contract by ASTRIUM, and the SAPHIR and SCARAB instruments developped by CNES with a support of the LMD, LERMA and CETP laboratories. CNES also provides the data processing algorithms for the SAPHIR and SCARAB instruments and participates to the development of the MADRAS data processing algorithms. A data and instruments performances expertise center will be created in France. For the French part, the level 2 and upper data processing will be realised in the thematic center Icare.",

      "The INSAT-3D spacecraft incorporates advanced Imager and Sounder instruments.",
      "The INSAT-3D imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band.",
      "The Imager is an improved design of VHRR/2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A missions. The instrument features 6 spectral bands (against the 3 bands in previous versions) offering an improved 1 km resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution.",
      "This new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors.",
      "The INSAT-3D sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional map of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere.",
      "The Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.",
      "Spectral parameters and sensitivity of the sounder",
      "Communication transponders are required to be configured to provide continuity of some of the INSAT services. A total satellite mass of 2000kg is considered for the launch compatibility, and 70 kg (approximately) of mass apportionment is done for the communication payload components. The communication payload components are - Meteorological Transmitter, Data Relay Transponder, Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R) Transponder & S-band Broadcast Satellite Services Transponder.",
